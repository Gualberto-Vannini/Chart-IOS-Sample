steps used for the creation of the chart:

1) Through CocoaPods installation of Charts' library and creation of .xcworkspace file. 
2) Importing Chart.xcodeproj and adding Charts library into Embedded Binaries
3) Creation of UIView with the lineChartView
4) Setting up of chart, animation, style and baloon markers. 
5) There aren't constrains, I was just focused on Charts library.
